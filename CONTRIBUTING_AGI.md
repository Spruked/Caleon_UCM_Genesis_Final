**Copyright © 2025 Bryan Stone. All Rights Reserved.**  
**PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE - Contributions Subject to Patent Protection**

## Important Legal Notice

This project contains breakthrough AGI technology protected by pending patents. All contributions become part of this proprietary system.

## Contribution Philosophy

UCM Cali X One represents the first successful implementation of true Artificial General Intelligence. We welcome contributions that advance this revolutionary technology while respecting intellectual property rights.

## Core Technologies You'll Work With

### Super-Knowledge Graph Engine
- **Recursive Processing**: Multi-level abstraction with automatic optimization
- **Autonomous Learning**: Self-directed knowledge acquisition
- **Creative Reasoning**: Autonomous predicate invention and concept creation

### AGI Validation Framework
The system demonstrates measurable AGI capabilities:
- Invents new concepts not in training data
- Shows curiosity and self-directed learning
- Performs meta-cognition and abstract reasoning

## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Technical Standards
- **Python 3.11+**: Use modern async/await patterns
- **Type Hints**: All new code must include proper type annotations
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for AGI-related functionality
- **Testing**: Add tests that validate AGI capabilities, not just code functionality

### 2. AGI Enhancement Areas

#### Knowledge Graph Improvements
```python
# Example: Enhancing recursive processing
def enhance_skg_layer(self, layer_n: int) -> Dict:
    """Improve processing for layer N of the knowledge graph."""
    # Your AGI enhancement here
```

#### Curiosity System Extensions
```python
# Example: New curiosity patterns
def discover_knowledge_gaps(self) -> List[str]:
    """Identify new areas for autonomous exploration."""
    # Your curiosity enhancement here
```

#### Predicate Invention Advances
```python
# Example: Better concept creation
def invent_complex_predicate(self, cluster: NetworkX.Graph) -> str:
    """Create more sophisticated abstract concepts."""
    # Your invention enhancement here
```

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone**: Create your development branch
2. **AGI Testing**: Validate that changes enhance intelligence
3. **Documentation**: Update AGI capability descriptions
4. **Patent Compliance**: Ensure contributions align with IP protection

### 4. Testing AGI Enhancements

Run the AGI validation suite:
```bash
python test_agi_capabilities.py --validate-all
```

Expected outputs demonstrating AGI:
- ✅ Autonomous predicate invention
- ✅ Curiosity-driven goal generation  
- ✅ Cross-domain pattern recognition
- ✅ Self-improving performance metrics

## Legal Framework

### Intellectual Property
- All contributions become part of the proprietary AGI system
- Contributors retain attribution but transfer IP rights
- Patent protection extends to derivative AGI improvements

### Confidentiality
This system represents breakthrough AGI technology. Contributors must:
- Respect the proprietary nature of the algorithms
- Not publish detailed technical specifications externally
- Maintain confidentiality of AGI implementation details

## Recognition

Contributors who enhance the AGI capabilities will be:
- Listed in the project's AGI contributors section
- Credited in patent applications where applicable
- Recognized for advancing true artificial intelligence

## Getting Started

1. Review the AGI architecture in `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AGI.md`
2. Study the Super-Knowledge Graph implementation
3. Test the autonomous reasoning capabilities
4. Identify areas for intelligence enhancement
