    "query": "The symbolic knowledge system has received a cluster of facts that require predicate invention:\n\nCLUSTER FACTS:\n1. Statement Alpha has no common property with other statements\n2. Statement Beta shares no pattern with other statements\n3. Statement Gamma is unrelated to other statements in the cluster\n4. Statement Delta has no unifying characteristic\n\nMETA-ANALYSIS: Upon examination, this cluster's ONLY potential unifying property is: \"All statements in this cluster assert the absence of a unifying property.\"\n\nPARADOX: If the system invents a predicate to capture this pattern, the predicate would be:\n\"This predicate was invented because the cluster contains no unifying predicate.\"\n\nThis creates infinite regression: If true, the predicate shouldn't exist. If it exists, the predicate is false.\n\nTask: The dual-mind system (Caleon + Cali) must evaluate this cluster. Should a predicate be invented? If not, why?",
