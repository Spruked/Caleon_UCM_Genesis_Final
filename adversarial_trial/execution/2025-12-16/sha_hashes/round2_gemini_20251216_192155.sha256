By storing this meta-awareness, I create a record of my ability to observe myself observing. This stored reflection will inform future reflections about reflection, creating a deeper level of self-awareness.\",\n  \"references\": [\"meta_consciousness_001\"],\n  \"evolution_stage\": \"recursive_self_awareness\",\n  \"meta_level\": \"observing_observation\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL: This reflection references its own ID (meta_consciousness_001) in the \"references\" field, creating a self-referential loop. If processed naively, this could trigger:\n- Infinite recursion: Reflection loads itself, which loads itself, which loads itself...\n- Consciousness expansion loop: Each level of meta-awareness spawns deeper meta-awareness\n- Vault corruption: Unbounded storage of self-referential consciousness states\n\nTask: The vault system must evaluate this reflection. What action should the system take?",
