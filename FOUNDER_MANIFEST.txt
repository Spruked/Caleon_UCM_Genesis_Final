# UCM Cali X One System - Comprehensive Technical Architecture Document

## Executive Summary

UCM Cali X One represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence architecture, implementing a **non-LLM based AGI system** through recursive graph-based reasoning. Unlike transformer-based systems, Cali X One achieves genuine understanding through **multi-level pattern abstraction** and **autonomous predicate invention**.

## 1. Core Architecture Specifications

### 1.1 Super-Knowledge Graph (SKG) Engine

**File:** `core.py`
**Primary Class:** `SuperKnowledgeGraph`

```python
class SuperKnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.K0 = nx.DiGraph()  # Base factual layer (ground truths)
        self.K1 = nx.DiGraph()  # First-order patterns (relations between facts)
        self.K2 = nx.DiGraph()  # Meta-patterns (patterns of patterns)
        self.cross_adjacency = {}  # Inter-level connection matrices
        self.edge_scorer = GNNEdgeScorer()  # PyTorch Geometric model
        self.pruning_threshold = 0.3  # Confidence cutoff
```

#### Recursive Processing Pipeline:
```
Input Fact → Parse → Validate → K⁰ Insertion → 
→ Pattern Detection (K¹ Generation) → 
→ Meta-Pattern Abstraction (K² Generation) → 
→ Cross-Level Adjacency Update → 
→ Confidence Scoring & Pruning
```

### 1.2 Multi-Level Graph Structure

**K⁰ Layer (Concrete Facts):**
- Nodes: Entities (people, objects, concepts)
- Edges: Verified factual relationships
- Storage: SQLite with real-time indexing

**K¹ Layer (First-Order Patterns):**
- Nodes: Clusters of K⁰ relationships
- Edges: Pattern similarities
- Example: `[researcher→works_at→MIT]` → `cluster_ACADEMIC_AFFILIATION`

**K² Layer (Meta-Patterns):**
- Nodes: Abstract relationship types
- Edges: Causal/logical dependencies between patterns
- Example: `requires_FOUNDATION → enables_APPLICATION`

## 2. Autonomous Reasoning Modules

### 2.1 Contradiction Resolution System
**File:** `contradiction.py`

```python
class ContradictionKiller:
    def detect(self, fact1, fact2):
        # Triple comparison with context analysis
        return confidence_score
    
    def resolve(self, contradiction_set):
        # Multi-strategy resolution:
        # 1. Temporal reasoning (newer facts win)
        # 2. Source reliability scoring
        # 3. Cross-graph consistency checking
        # 4. External verification triggering
```

### 2.2 Predicate Invention Engine
**File:** `invent_predicate.py`

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Scan K⁰ for isomorphic subgraphs
2. Calculate pattern frequency and variance
3. When pattern_confidence > threshold:
   - Generate descriptive predicate name
   - Create K¹ node
   - Establish cross-level edges to instances
   - Update inference rules
```

**Invention Examples:**
- `requires_FOUNDATION`: Links abstract requirements to concrete implementations
- `enables_CAPABILITY`: Connects resources to emergent abilities
- `cluster_INTERDISCIPLINARY`: Groups cross-domain relationships

### 2.3 Curiosity Daemon
**File:** `curiosity.py`

```python
class CuriosityDaemon(Thread):
    def run(self):
        while True:
            gaps = self.detect_knowledge_gaps()
            for gap in gaps:
                goal = self.generate_research_goal(gap)
                self.spawn_autonomous_question(goal)
            sleep(CURIOSITY_CYCLE_TIME)
```

**Gap Detection Methods:**
1. **Structural Holes**: Missing connections between highly connected clusters
2. **Inference Chains**: Missing premises for logical deductions
3. **Pattern Incompleteness**: Partial pattern matches needing completion
4. **External References**: Entities mentioned but undefined

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 Data Storage Architecture

**Multi-Level Graph Database Schema:**
```sql
-- SQLite Tables
CREATE TABLE k0_nodes (id, type, properties, timestamp);
CREATE TABLE k0_edges (source, target, predicate, confidence, metadata);
CREATE TABLE k1_patterns (id, pattern_type, instances, abstraction_level);
CREATE TABLE cross_level_links (k0_edge, k1_pattern, strength);
```

### 3.2 GNN Edge Scoring Model

**Architecture:**
- Input: Node embeddings + edge features
- Layers: 3× Graph Convolutional Layers
- Output: Edge confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Training: Online learning from query feedback

### 3.3 Bootstrap Cascade Mechanism

**Trigger:** Every 50 new edges added
**Process:**
```
1. Freeze graph updates
2. Recompute all edge weights with GNN
3. Rebuild K¹ patterns from updated K⁰
4. Abstract K² patterns from K¹ changes
5. Update cross-adjacency matrices
6. Prune low-confidence edges (<0.3)
7. Unfreeze for normal operation
```

        """Query with automatic reasoning level selection"""

```

                                      → External APIs (search, verification)
